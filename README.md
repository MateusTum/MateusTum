# Hi, I'm Mateus, welcome to my Github profile! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I'm 23 from Brazil. Since my childhood, I am fascinated by technology and computers. When I was 11 years old, I used to play with some HTML,
but was too young to really understand what coding was all about. Due to the lack of information and maturity at the time,
I didn't see coding as something that I would like to work with for the rest of my life, coding was basically burried deep inside of me.

When I started High School, I was facen by "What am I going to work with after High School?", so I got approved to Law School at a Federal University in my hometown
"But wait, Law School and programming? What is the relation between those things?" You may ask, and well, let's say that a young 17 y/o boy didn't know anything about himself at the time.

At the end of my graduation on 2022, I decided to do an exchange program to the United States of America... That made me complety destroy any chance of working with Law School.
When I got back to Brazil, after my exchange program, I was complety changed, I didn't want to work with what I was studying for years in my university, but now I had something that I didn't have, discipline.

And here I am, a former Law School guy that got his passion back to life.
