<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
        I'm a 23-year-old from Brazil with a lifelong passion for technology and computers.
        My journey into the world of coding began at a young age when I dabbled in HTML at the age of 11,
        even though I couldn't fully grasp its depth at the time.
        This early exposure sparked a hidden interest in coding within me.
</p>
<p>
        As I approached the end of my high school years, I faced the inevitable question:
        "What career path should I pursue after graduation?"
        I found myself accepted into Law School at a Federal University in my hometown.
        The choice between Law School and programming may seem perplexing,
        especially for a 17-year-old who was still discovering himself.
</p>
<p>
        Fast forward to 2022, and I successfully completed my law degree.
        However, during that time, I embarked on an exchange program to the United States,
        which transformed me and my perspective.
        Upon returning to Brazil, I had undergone a profound change.
        I realized that I no longer wanted to pursue a career in law,
        but I had gained something invaluable: discipline.
</p>
<p>
        Now, I'm wholeheartedly dedicated to pursuing my passion for coding and technology,
        armed with the discipline I acquired during my journey.
